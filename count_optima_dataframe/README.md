# Counting optima

`count_optima_dataframe/count_optima_p=1-6_nQ=4-16.p`
is the data frame containing all the QAOA optima counting results
under error threshold of 0.03, p=1,2,3,4,5,6 and number of qubits=
4,6,8,10,12,14,16.

Visualization see [vis_count_optima.ipynb](../vis_count_optima.ipynb).

P.S. This data does not contain `p=4,5,6` for `n_qubits=16` since
it takes so much time.

Naming routine:

- p: p of QAOA
- nQ: number of qubits
